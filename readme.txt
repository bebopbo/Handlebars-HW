To get heroku working:

resources> jawsdb >enter credit card > make free jaws db

click on jawsdb link> copy login info, dbname, user, password, databaseName> you app is now connected to that db

BUT that database isn't structured correctly!

now login to that database using mysql workbench using the exact same login info

use the same seeds to create the same table

make sure the new, nonsense term, database name is used universally across app (not sure if used in more than one place)
